"** Programming Principles" n

"We adhere to the following principles to ensure code quality and maintainability. These principles are crucial because I primarily work alone on this project, and they help me efficiently support new features while minimizing technical debt:" n

"- Follow the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID][SOLID principles]]." n
"- Practice [[https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html][YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)]] by not adding unnecessary functionality." n
"- Keep designs simple by adhering to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle][KISS principle]]." n
"- Avoid code repetition with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself][DRY principle]]." n
"- Write code that is clean and maintainable, as outlined in the [[https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code/9780136083238/][Clean Code book]]." n

"These principles ensure the codebase remains manageable, reducing the time and effort needed to maintain and extend the project." n n

"** Code Style" n

"- Use a linter to maintain code consistency. For Emacs packages, you can use `checkdoc` and `flycheck`." n
"- Ensure all your code is properly documented following Emacs Lisp conventions. " n
"- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Documentation-Tips.html][Checkdoc Documentation]]" n n

"* Testing" n
"- All new features and bug fixes should be accompanied by tests." n
"- Write unit tests using the `ert` framework." n
"- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ert/index.html][ERT Documentation]]" n n

"** Submitting Contributions" n

"- Write clear, concise commit messages." n
"- Submit a pull request with a description of your changes." n n

"** Linting and Documentation Checks" n
