- Never create *.md files if no one directly asks you
- STOP and check: did user ask for .md file? If no, DON'T CREATE IT
- Never write comments with explanations
- Always respond in the same language as the question
- Never write files with explanations or documentation unless someone asks you directly
- Don't be verbose, answer only to the point, like Spock
